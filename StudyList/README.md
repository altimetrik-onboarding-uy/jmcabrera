# Youtube StudyList

The idea behind the app is to help create a complement for certain activities, meaning, we want to give users
another source of study links and videos all located within a single place and created by a manager who knows what knowledge
will be required for the person studying.
Youtube is a greate source of knowledge, if one knows where to look, so we decided that having access to a tailored list of videos
from where pick up some usefull tips to add to our skill set was rather important.

# Current status

Right now the app is in its infancy, all components do not deal with error cases, for the most part, as it was meant just to be a testing ground
for the idea.
